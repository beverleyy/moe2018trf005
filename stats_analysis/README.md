4 groups of data based on 1 independent variable, and 2 dependent variables.

Data is organized into a file `data.mat` as 4 (nx2) vectors based on the independent variables.


### Randomized IRR

Aim is to test the effect of sample size on the calculation of IRR across 2 raters

Data is organized as an Nx2 double matrix, with N = size of data
